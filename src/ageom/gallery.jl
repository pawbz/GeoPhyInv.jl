AGeom=Vector{AGeomss,1}
```
An acquisition geometry, bundled into the mutable `AGeom` type,
has to be specified in order to
create any `Expt` variable.
Acquisition has supersources, sources and receivers.
For `AGeom` is a mutable type to define source-receiver geometry. 
Each supersource has `ns` sources that are
injected (or active) simultaneously, and 
a set of `nr` receivers to 
record. 
`AGeomss` is a subtype for each supersource, therefore:
This package provides tools to easily create commonly-used `AGeom` instances, 
after deciding on a spatial grid `mgrid` for the experiment.

##### Indexing and Fields
Let `ageom` be an instance of this type, then fields 
can be accessed using:

* `ageom[i]` : acquisition for ith supersource
* `ageom[i].s[p]` : position coordinates of sources where `p ∈ [:z, :x, :y]`
* `ageom[i].r[p]` : position coordinates of receivers
* `ageom[i].ns` : number of sources 
* `ageom[i].nr` : number of receivers

##### Gallery
```julia
ageom=AGeom(mgrid, attrib, SSrcs(10), Recs(20))
```
Return pre-defined acquisition geometries (in this case with 10 supersources and 20 receivers), based on `attrib`, on an input mesh `mgrid`.
The sources and receivers positions are same for all supersources, and are not placed on the edges of the mesh.
Choose `attrib::Symbol`
* `=:xwell` cross-well acquisition;
* `=:surf` surface acquisition;
* `=:vsp` vertical seismic profiling;
* `=:rvsp`  reverse vertical seismic profiling;
* `=:downhole` downhole sources and receivers.


TODO: For 3D, just mean(ygrid) is used, need to work on more exotic gallery of 3D acquisitions.
